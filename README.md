# MinecraftCosmeticAPI
This is the Minecraft cosmetic API designed to be used along side the [MinecraftWebSocket](https://github.com/ethan-davies/MinecraftWebSocket) project. Just as a heads up, this repository is incapible of working as an actual API without adding you're own custom database integration code. 


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethan-davies/MinecraftCosmeticAPI.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd MinecraftCosmeticAPI
```

3. Install the required dependencies using a package manager like pnpm, npm or yarn:

```bash
$ pnpm install
# or
$ npm install
# or
$ yarn install
```

Then, to start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
$ pnpm dev
# or
$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
```

For testing purposes use this endpoint: [/cosmetics/testUsername](http://localhost:8080/cosmetics/testUsername).
